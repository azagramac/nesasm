                - added a new predefined function SIZEOF that returns
                  the size of a data element (ex. included with #INCBIN)
                - added four experimental directives .proc/.endp,

                - fixed a little bug in the expression parser.
                - merged the code of the NES and the PCE assembler, now
                  there's only one program.
                - made the code more portable; it can now be compiled
                  without any change on most Unix systems.
                - added '.byte' and '.word' directives (same as '.db' and
                  '.dw') for compatibility with other assemblers.
                - added a new command line switch, '-srec' to ouput a
                  Motorola S-record file (for EEPROM/EPROM programming).
